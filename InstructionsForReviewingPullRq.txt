Instructions for Reviewing Pull Requests

1) Go to the relevant bitbucket repository on the Arc Bitbucket web. 
E.g., for V's pull request on neural nets data preprocessing, I went to:
https://bitbucket.org/arcbioinformatics/infinity/branch/VN

2) Clone the repository to your local machine:
$git clone https://bitbucket.org/arcbioinformatics/infinity/branch/VN 

3) By default you will be on the dev branch in your local cloned repository. 
You may have to change the branch depending on the pull request. E.g. I 
had to go to VN branch. 

$ git checkout VN

4) Go to the Arc Bitbucket web and click on Pull requests. You can add your 
comments there. You can click on the relevant code and add comments under it.
