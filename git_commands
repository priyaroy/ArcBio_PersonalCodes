To start working on a new branch on arcbio bitbucket (once you have created it):
1) $cd <local_dir>  # where you want to upload/create codes for pull request
2) $git clone <path_to_bitbucket_branch>
 e.g. $git clone https://bitbucket.org/arcbioinformatics/panini/branch/feature/Chidotu_filters
 
 Next, check that you are in the branch and not in master. For this, do
 $git branch
 It should show feature/Chidotu_filters
 
 3) Next, create a suitable virtualenv for this branch in your local machine. Add code and test. 
    
 4) To add (stage) a file to branch: $git add <filename>
 5) To remove a file from being committed to master (i.e. unstage): $ git reset HEAD <filename_to_be_removed>
 
 6) Commit the changes: $git commit <filename> -m "added blablabla"
                                        OR
                        $ git commit -m "your comments"       # to commit all files at once 
 
 7) Push the changes to the branch: $git push origin <branch_name>
                              E.g.: $git push origin feature/Chidotu_filters
                              
 8) If you make a new branch in the same git repo and you want to fetch that branch into your local git repo,
    $git fetch && git checkout <branch_name>
    
    E.g. git fetch && git checkout feature/Get_reads_labels
