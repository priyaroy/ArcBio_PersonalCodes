1) Clone attacca_wrapper from Arc bitbucket: 
https://bitbucket.org/arcbioinformatics/attacca_wrapper/src/master/

Make sure that your bitbucket has the id_rsa key for tars. Only then you will be able to git clone.

2) Create a new virtualenv: 

$ virtualenv venv_attacca

3) Install attacca 
$cd <attacca_wrapper_dir>
VERY IMP: $source venve_attacca/bin/activate
(If u do not activate your virtual env, then you will get a 'permission denied' error since it will try to install globally.)

$pip install .

If you get a pip error, it could be a problem with your pip.conf file. Get the right index-url for your pip.conf file from Isaac. 

4) To annotate a fasta file using attacca:

   $luigi --module attacca.attacca RunAttacca --ldb <input.fasta> --directory <outputDir>
   
   NOTE: 1) Give the full paths for the <input.fasta> and <outputDir> directories! Otherwise, you will run into errors.
         2) Be sure that the fasta files start with a header '>fastaid' or something that starts with '>' (without the quotes). 
         Otherwise you will run into parse error.
        
        
5) The main output is the <>fasta.filtered_terts.xml file. It has feature_name, type, position, length etc.
