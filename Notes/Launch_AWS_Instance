Isaac's instructions:
https://arc-bio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BF/pages/136609793/How+To+-+Launch+Instance+In+AWS

In a nutshell, 

1) Install arcbio-tools following the instructions given in the above link
2) $ cd ~/arcbio-tools/idp_in_aws/create_instance
3) emacs env.sh
   * Change VOL_SIZE (It is in GB. For RNN,try 100 GB. Currently the total size of my RNN folder is 44 GB.)
   * Change EC2_INSTANCE_SIZE try g3.4xlarge(16 core, 122 GB, $1.14 ph)
     as recommended for RNN by https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/
   
     Alex suggested either p3.2xlarge (8 CPU, 61 GB mem, $3.06 per hour) 
                                      or p2.xlarge (4 CPU, 61 GB mem, $0.9 per hour)
  * Change EC2_INSTANCE_NAME to 'Roy_RNN_%' current date
  
  
  4) To launch an instance $./launch.sh create
  you will get a message 
       -----------------------------------------
          *********    PLEASE NOTE!!!    *********
          To Login:
                    ssh -i ~/.ssh/cloud arc@<aws-server-ip-address>
          .
          .
          .
       ----------------------------------------

STORE THE LOGIN COMMAND DISPLAYED IN THE ABOVE MESSAGE FOR FUTURE USE
  
  5) Next go to your instance to upload codes, data and to install libraries.
    For this, first go to the instance using the stored login command.
   
    a) Cp your local training data, codes etc to s3. 
    b) cp the training data, codes etc from s3 to your instance AT /DATA01/  using the aws command, like you do in servers. 
    
    Alternatively (not recommended though since it is good to have a copy on s3), you can load directly from 
    your local machine to the AWS instance:

     (on your local machine) $screen -S cpFolderToAWSInstance

                             $ scp -i ~/.ssh/cloud -r <full-path-of-folder-to-copy> arc<aws-server-ip-address>:/DaTA01/
                                                   
    c) Install python3 virtual environment in your instance. 
    d) Install all required packages in your python3 virtual environment.
    
 6) When an instance completes the submitted job, COPY ALL RESULTS TO S3. THIS IS A MUST!!!
 
 7) Now it is safe to delete the instance To delete, run $./launch.sh delete in your local machine from where you had
    created the instance (in this case, first $cd ~/arcbio-tools/idp_in_aws/create_instance, then $./launch.sh delete)
