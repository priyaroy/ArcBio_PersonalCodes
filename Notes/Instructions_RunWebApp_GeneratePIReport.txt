Input files needed: demultiplexed fastqs with names having the following format:
                    
                     <sample_name>_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
                     <sample_name>_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

Note: You can find the AWS link to all clinical samples on this website: 
https://arc-bio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BF/pages/647069740/Sequencing+Run+and+Analysis+Archival

Under 'Partner Site Data Access'. E.g. s3://arcbio.research.com/WEEKLY/Sequencing_Site_Data/UCL/Beta/CalibrationRun 


Steps:

 1) Go to the laptop called 'Mimosa' in Arc Bio that is dedicated to this purpose. It is on the standing desk. Using this laptop prevents the possibility of interrupting an analysis by mistake. 

Download the fastqs from was s3:

    $aws s3 cp s3://arcbio.research.com/WEEKLY/Sequencing_Site_Data/UCL/Beta/ <path_to_your_local_dir>

2) Inside the runs, check that the fastq files have the recommended name style '<sample_name>_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz'. If not, then make it like that using rename command.

    $ rename 's/_R1_/_L001_R1_/' *.gz # replaces _R1_ with _L001_R1_
    $ rename 's/_R2_/_L001_R2_/' *.gz

VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure that the file names of each fastq is 

<Lib_name>_SXX_L001_RX_001.fastq.gz

Here lib name must match the sample ID that you enter during 'configure run', SXX can be S followed by any integer (0-whatever), RX is R1 or R2. Corresponding to one lib_name, the app will automatically expect two fastqs, *_R1_*.gz and *_R2_*.gz.
 
 2) Go to the web app page https://testing.arcbio.com/welcome. You will need an account (request it from one of 
    the devOps like Sean). 

 3) Go to the 'Runs' page. 
     a) If you already have the run uploaded, then select the run.
     b) If you do not have the run uploaded to the web app, then configure the run: 
         i) Set plate barcode to MP0012
         ii) Sample/control ID are the libraries. Enter the library names (LI-XX or LIB-XX or whatever the names 
             are in your sample data). E.g. for 01_S3_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz, the lib name should be 01
         iii)Index well position: if you do not know the positions apriori, set them to arbitrary positions, making
             sure that the positions you choose are unique for each library.
         iv) Label your samples/libraries as High Run Control, Low Run Control or samples as deemed appropriate. This will create the run. Record the run #. Go to the run and upload the fastq files. 

         v) Upload the demultiplexed fastqs using the 'Upload' button. 


 4) As soon as you upload the libraries, the GPS pipeline will start analyzing them and generate QC & PI reports. 
    The PI report contains pathogen id and the corresponding signal (essentially f(Evidence)). 

There is no indicator to track the progress in the analysis, but it typically takes 90 mins to finish a 
common-sized run.
